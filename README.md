## Weeks
This is to track my progress in the 100 days of code  lesson that I was taking during my courses in university. Each day has a concept that is well explained and with each day, there are projects that were done according to the concept discussed each day. 
## Team Jiraiya project 
Now this is the project given to me by my leturer after taking days 1 - 14 to simulate the sound level of a lawn mower reaching a person that is inside a room made of three different materials and a person outside the room. Each and every part of this project is a sample code which shows the code used for the following sub problems:
* Create a function to calculate sound level - Akinwale Akinkunmi
* Simulate the soound penetration in the room - Adewale Usman
* Simulate the sound penetration outside the room - Olatunji Goodness
* Simulate the main program if the user is in the room - Oyesiji Titilope
* Simulate the main program  if the user is outside the room - Akinkunmi Akinwale
